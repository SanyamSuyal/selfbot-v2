# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ❌ "Cannot send an empty message" Error

This error occurs when using discord.js-selfbot-v13 and trying to send embeds without a content field.

**Problem:** 
```javascript
message.channel.send({ embeds: [embed] }); // ❌ This causes the error
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
message.channel.send({ content: ' ', embeds: [embed] }); // ✅ This works
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - All commands have been updated to include the content field.

### 🔄 Quick Test

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```
!test        # Test command with embed
!help        # Help command (should work now)
!joke        # Joke command (should work now)
!ping        # Ping command
```

### 🛠️ If You Still Get Errors

1. **Restart the bot** - Sometimes the Node.js cache needs to be cleared
2. **Check your token** - Make sure it's valid and not expired
3. **Check permissions** - Ensure you can send messages in the channel
4. **Update dependencies** - Run `npm update` to get the latest versions
