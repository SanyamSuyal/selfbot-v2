# Advanced Discord Selfbot - Security Policy

**Created by Sanyam Suyal**

## üîí Security Overview

This project is designed for educational purposes and includes several security considerations. While selfbots inherently violate Discord's Terms of Service, we strive to implement responsible security practices.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email the details to: [Create an email for Sanyam]
4. **DO** provide detailed steps to reproduce
5. **DO** suggest potential fixes if possible

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation steps
- Your contact information for follow-up

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Token Security
- **Never commit tokens** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Rotate tokens regularly** if compromised
- **Use secondary accounts** for testing
- **Monitor for unauthorized access**

### Code Security
- **Input validation** on all user inputs
- **Rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
- **Error handling** to prevent information disclosure
- **Secure dependencies** kept up to date
- **No hardcoded secrets** in source code

### Runtime Security
- **Principle of least privilege** for bot permissions
- **Monitoring and logging** for suspicious activity
- **Graceful error handling** to prevent crashes
- **Resource limits** to prevent DoS
- **Secure configuration** options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### Selfbot Risks
- **Account termination** risk from Discord
- **IP blocking** for suspicious activity
- **Rate limiting** can trigger detection
- **API abuse** can result in permanent bans
- **Personal data exposure** through logging

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use **secondary accounts only**
- Implement **respectful rate limiting**
- **Monitor API usage** carefully
- **Clear logs** of sensitive information
- **Regular security updates**

## üîß Security Features

### Built-in Protection
- **Cooldown systems** prevent command spam
- **Error boundaries** prevent crashes from exposing data
- **Input sanitization** for command arguments
- **Secure configuration** using environment variables
- **Activity logging** for monitoring usage

### Configuration Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Default secure settings
- Optional debug modes
- Configurable rate limits
- Secure token handling

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Using
- [ ] Create secondary Discord account
- [ ] Configure `.env` file properly
- [ ] Review all command permissions
- [ ] Understand Discord ToS implications
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### During Use
- [ ] Monitor for unusual activity
- [ ] Respect rate limits
- [ ] Avoid suspicious behavior patterns
- [ ] Keep logs secure and private
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly

### After Use
- [ ] Clear sensitive logs
- [ ] Rotate tokens if needed
- [ ] Review account activity
- [ ] Document any issues
- [ ] Share learnings responsibly

## üö´ What We Don't Do

### No Data Collection
- We don't collect user data
- We don't store messages permanently
- We don't track usage analytics
- We don't share information with third parties
- We don't implement backdoors

### No Malicious Features
- No keyloggers or data harvesting
- No unauthorized access attempts
- No spreading or botnet functionality
- No exploitation of Discord vulnerabilities
- No promotion of Terms of Service violations

## üìö Educational Security Goals

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding Discord API security
- Implementing responsible automation
- Learning about rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Understanding the importance of secure coding practices
- Recognizing the security implications of selfbots

### Responsible Use
- This software is for **educational purposes only**
- Users must understand the **risks and consequences**
- We promote **responsible disclosure** of security issues
- We encourage **ethical hacking and security research**
- We emphasize **respecting platform Terms of Service**

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Update Process
1. Security issues are prioritized for immediate fixes
2. Updates are tested thoroughly before release
3. Security patches are clearly documented
